# Introduction-to-LLMs
Jupyter notebooks designed by Dr. Eugenio Tufino to introduce how LLMs work - for students of the course "Teaching and Learning Physics" 
taught by Dr. Marta Carli in 2024 at the University of Padova. 
The version 2 of the Jupyter Notebooks was the updated version based on classroom implementation during two lessons in December 2024. 
This is linked to the submitted article "
Exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) through interactive Python activities" The version 3 added a Colab badge and correct notebook metadata for rendering on GitHub.

Note: the introductory Jupyter Notebook remains unchanged
