        "In this notebook, we present GPT-2, a simplified model compared to the state-of-the-art generative models such as  GPT-4 or OpenAI o1, the model just released. GPT-2 is based on the **Generative Pre-trained Transformer** architecture and was released by OpenAI in **2019**. It uses a relatively simple mechanism to generate text, predicting the next word in a sequence based on the given context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore unlike Word2Vec, where as we have seen word vectors are static (the same vector represents a word regardless of its usage), GPT-2 **dynamically adjusts the word representation** based on its context. This allows GPT-2 to better capture the meaning of words in different situations, resulting in more coherent and contextually accurate text generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will explore this model to understand, in a simplified way, how this kind of generative AI works, focusing on its word generation process and how prompts affect its output.\n",

        "GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, highlighting its key features:\n",
        "- Generative: The model generates coherent and meaningful text.\n",
        "- Pre-trained: It is trained on large datasets before being fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n",
        "- Transformer: It uses the Transformer architecture for efficient and context-aware text generation.\n",

The solar system's rotation slows down when the Earth spins, so the solar wind is pulled in two directions. It takes a lot of energy to turn the two sides of a circle around each other...\n",
